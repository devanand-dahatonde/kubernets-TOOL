# StatefulSet
A StatefulSet runs a group of Pods, and maintains a sticky identity for each of those Pods. 
This is useful for managing applications that need persistent storage or a stable, unique network identity.

StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following:

Stable, unique network identifiers.
Stable, persistent storage.
Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.
Ordered, automated rolling updates.

#### Example 1:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: redis
spec:
  serviceName: "redis"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: redis
        image: redis:5.0.5
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6379
          name: redis
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: redis-data
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```
